    Example using the state pattern
    1. A blog post starts as an empty draft.
    2. When the draft is done, a review of the post is requested.
    3. When the post is approved, it gets published.
    4. Only published blog posts return content to print, so unapproved posts canâ€™t accidentally be published.
